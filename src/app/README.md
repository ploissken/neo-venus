# ðŸ§© App Directory (`/app`)

> **Next.js App Router** structure â€” core pages, layouts, and route handlers live here.

This folder defines the root application structure using the Next.js **App Router** (introduced in Next 13). It handles routing, layouts, and server-side logic via API routes.

## ðŸ§± Structure

    /app
      â”œâ”€â”€ /about           # Static route for the "About" page
      â”œâ”€â”€ /api             # Route handlers (acts as API endpoints)
      â”œâ”€â”€ /user-profile    # User profile page (wip)
      â”œâ”€â”€ layout.tsx       # Shared layout across all routes
      â””â”€â”€ page.tsx         # Root '/' page â€” homepage content

## ðŸ’¡ Notes

- Built using the **Next.js App Router** â€” every directory is either a **page**, **layout**, or **API route**.
- Each route is **file-system based**, meaning folder names = URLs.
- Route handlers in `/api` can replace traditional `/pages/api/*` endpoints.
