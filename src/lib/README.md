# ðŸ“š Lib Directory (`/lib`)

> Core shared logic, types, and constants â€” used across the app and features.

The `/lib` folder contains **non-UI code** that powers the core functionality of the app. This includes constants, reusable types, and helper functions.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes on Structure

> This structure may evolve as the codebase grows â€” refactoring is expected!

- **Constants & Types** are colocated by domain (`chart.*`, `location.*`) to improve discoverability.
- **Helper functions** are kept pure and decoupled from React, which makes them easy to:
  - Test
  - Reuse in client/server environments
  - Optimize separately from UI concerns
