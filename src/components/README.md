# ðŸ§© Components Directory (`/components`)

> Reusable, composable UI blocks that make up the visual structure of the app.

This folder contains the building blocks of the interface â€” from atomic elements (like icons and logos) to larger layout chunks (like navigation, page containers or data renderers). Components are modular and grouped by feature when appropriate.
