# ðŸŒŸ Features Directory (`/features`)

> Self-contained feature modules for specific UI and logic.

This folder organizes **feature-driven modules** â€” each folder contains the components and logic related to a single functional domain.

## ðŸ“š What we have so far

    /features
      â”œâ”€â”€ /about         # static container with some (poor) information about the app. To be improved!
      â”œâ”€â”€ /create-chart  # for the creation of anonymous charts, based on date, time and location
      â”œâ”€â”€ /home          # currently it displays the astral chart for the current sky, with optional location consideration
      â”œâ”€â”€ /user          # WIP: will contain user info, preferences, settings and created charts

## ðŸ§  Why Feature-Based?

This approach:

- Reduces coupling across the codebase
- Keeps related files together
- Makes large projects easier to scale and onboard new devs
